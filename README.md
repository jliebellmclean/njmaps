Welcome to my final project for PAI 600 at the Maxwell School! 

In this project, you'll find three main folders that organize the inputs and outputs.

In the data folder, you'll find the data sets I use. Find explanations about their source in the scripts themselves or in my report.

In the scripts folder, there are four scripts which can be run to perform the analysis. They use data in the data folder as well as data from the US Census. It shouldn't matter what order you run the scripts in.

In the figures folder, you will find the results of running the four scripts. There is also a PDF copy of my PowerPoint presentation delivered in class.

In the main folder, there are versions of my final report in markdown and rendered as a PDF.
